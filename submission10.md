# Cloud Computing Lab - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

1. **Research Artifact Registries**:
   - Explore AWS, GCP, and Azure services and documentation to identify the most popular artifact registries available.

    **Key features**:

    Amazon Web Services (AWS):
    AWS is known for its extensive service portfolio and global infrastructure, offering a wide range of computing, storage, database, AI/ML, and networking services.
    It provides a robust ecosystem with a large user base, comprehensive documentation, and mature DevOps tools.
    AWS offers flexible pricing options, including pay-as-you-go and reserved instances, catering to various budgetary requirements.
    
    Microsoft Azure:
    Azure seamlessly integrates with Microsoft's suite of products, making it an attractive choice for organizations already using Microsoft technologies.
    It offers a broad range of services similar to AWS, along with a strong focus on hybrid cloud capabilities and enterprise integrations.
    Azure provides comprehensive support for Windows-based applications and has a growing ecosystem of AI/ML services.
    
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
    GCP emphasizes its data analytics, machine learning, and AI capabilities, making it suitable for organizations with a focus on data-driven decision-making.
    It offers services like BigQuery for analytics and TensorFlow for machine learning, along with a strong emphasis on containerization with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
    GCP's pricing model is often competitive, particularly for workloads that involve data processing and analytics.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

1. **Research Best Serverless Computing Platforms**:
   - Investigate AWS, GCP, and Azure services and resources to identify the best serverless computing platforms available on each cloud platform.

   I've investigated services and found those platforms:

    AWS CodePipeline: fully managed (CI/CD) service.
    It enables you to build, test, and deploy applications automatically, using a visual interface or code-driven pipelines.
    CodePipeline integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS CodeCommit for source code management and AWS CodeBuild for build automation.

    Azure DevOps: suite of development tools and services provided by Microsoft Azure.
    It includes capabilities for source code management, continuous integration, testing, artifact management, and release automation.
    Azure DevOps supports tight integration with Azure services and offers flexible pipelines for building and deploying applications.

    Google Cloud Build: fully managed CI/CD platform that provides fast, consistent, and scalable builds.
    It supports building applications from source code repositories, including GitHub and Bitbucket, and integrates with other GCP services.
    Cloud Build allows you to define build configurations using a simple YAML-based syntax.
